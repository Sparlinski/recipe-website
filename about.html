        <h2 class="about_heading">ABOUT</h2>
        <p class="about_intro"><span class="about_intro_bold">The goal of Simply Delicious is twofold: to provide healthy, clean, easy-to-make dishes that don't skimp on flavor, and to offer a convenient weekly meal plan menu, that supplies dinner, lunches or leftovers for the entire week. A meal plan service for those that like to cook!</span>
        Simply Delicious was inspired by two peopleâ€”my mom and dad. Growing up, my parents had different levels of cooking expertise and frequency. My mom was the weeknight cook, while my dad was the weekend chef. My mom's cooking was serviceable, and she would admit that herself, but she was also efficient. She prepared meals with minimal fuss and cook time. However, I watched her struggle with the daily decision of what to make and the frequent trips to the grocery store to pick up ingredients. It was the bane of her existence. So I thought to myself, why not develop a weekly recipe plan and gather all the ingredients in one trip to the store? This forms the first part of Simply Delicious.
        My dad was a terrific cook, and he used the extra time the weekend offered to make dinners that were simply delicious! His range of cooking was vast; he combined flavors and ingredients in very creative ways, with an eclectic mix of recipes from around the world. His food was made with love and care and never lacked real flavor. This forms the second part of Simply Delicious.
        I am a little bit of both of my parents. I am by no means a chef, or to the level of my Dad, but I have a good sense of what tastes good and how to put together a meal. I wanted to create a website that offers the convenience of meal planning by setting a variety of weekly menus. Removing the daily decision of what to make and the daily trip to the store with all the ingredients needed for each dish in one shopping list, while still providing flavor and variety. Above all else, I aimed to provide healthy, clean recipes with balanced, wholesome ingredients that contain no added sugars, preservatives, additives, or trans fats. The serving sizes can be adjusted to provide dinners, leftovers for lunch the next day, or extra meals for the weekend or busy times. I hope you enjoy the recipes and the flavors.</p>
